# Idea backlog (ordered; update freely as evidence accumulates)

- i1 (baseline): multi-house pretrain, multi-output dilated CNN, no calibration use.
  Hypothesis: source-house labels fix the K-only underfit; min_device_f1 >> 0.
- i2: + calibration fine-tune on the K=5 house_1 sessions (light, low LR).
- i3: train longer (15-30 epochs) with early stop on source-val loss.
- i4: loss shaping - per-device BCE pos_weight sweep; ON/OFF hysteresis on predictions.
- i5: episode post-processing - min-duration snapping, hysteresis at 0.9x threshold
  (fhmm FROZEN anchor_off_factor convention).
- i6: input features - mains delta, rolling std/mean (onset detectability).
- i7: architecture - wider channels, more dilation, GRU hybrid, window 256.
- i8: more source data - house_4 (3 devices, masked heads) + house_3 (kettle).
- i9: per-device output calibration from the K sessions (bias correction).
- i10: energy-balance constraint (attributed energy vs aggregate; residual aware).
- i11: augmentation - gain jitter, noise injection, dropout on input scale.
- i12: DROPPED (2026-09-27, user): robustness to coarser sampling is unnecessary - the client meter collects at native 1 Hz; benchmark stays on the frozen 6 s UK-DALE contract.
- i13: per-device threshold snapping from calibration stats. REFUTED (run-4
  diagnostics): calib sessions are window-centered and ON-heavy (wm/dw 72-84%
  ON) - thresholds swept on them are biased; do not revive without new data.
- i14: seq2point auxiliary head for sharper onsets.
- i5: episode post-processing - duration filter. REFUTED by source-channel
  audit (EXP-06): GT episodes are 2-sample-blip dominated in ALL houses; a
  duration filter would delete the matchable majority.

Research-derived backlog (2026-09-28, user-directed exploration of
docs/research/analog-problems.md + transfer-applicability-audit.md; the
EXP-08 GT diagnostic showed eval GT is threshold-crossing-blip dominated
for every device: fridge 28034 eps 83% <=36s, wm 85%, kettle 58% - so
episode-coherence and step-detection machinery, not cycle classification,
is where F1 lives):

- i15 (analog-problems S2.1 + S4 step 4, factorial-HMM decode): VALIDATED
  as the loop's strongest mechanism (runs 10-14, all logged with evidence).
  Keep the v5 net as an amortized posterior estimator; predict = exact
  additive-factorial max-plus decode over 2^5=32 joint states: emissions =
  shifted per-device posterior log-liks (logit shift by the calib gate so
  the v5 decision boundary is preserved) + soft sum-to-aggregate Gaussian
  (sigma = aggregate-minus-devices residual std on SOURCE houses = 497 W);
  transitions UNIFORM (constant logA -> per-position joint MAP). Wins:
  wm F1 0.007 -> 0.335 (806 matches, P 0.435), kettle 0.354 at P 0.537
  with MAE 6.7 W (v14), fridge 0.094 at P 0.412, MAE -31%, coverage 0.437.
  Caveat: primary (min_device_f1) still capped by dw ~0.002 -> the family
  is kept out of the mainline until the min device clears v5's 0.0072;
  full recipe reproducible from run logs 10-14.
- i16 (analog-problems S2.3 patch-clamp kinetics): REFUTED for this
  benchmark (runs 10/13, clean single-knob A/Bs): sticky dwell priors in
  EITHER direction (source-mean p_cont 0.97; calib-mean-matched 0.75-0.88
  + OFF 0.97) lengthen episodes past the frozen duration band [1/3, 3] ->
  fridge/dw exactly 0; the uniform/none regime wins. The median-matched
  form was inert (clamped) - run 12 proved v11 == v12 bit-identical. Do
  not revive without a changed emission scale.
- i17 (analog-problems S2.4 + S4 step 1): TV-1D / fused-lasso denoise of
  mains as input preprocessing - staircase-preserving, keeps step edges
  that the ON head needs; cheap input-side variant of i6.
- i18 (analog-problems S2.5 + S4 step 2): PELT/ruptures changepoint event
  layer - candidate events (time, delta-P) either as extra input features
  or as onset-snapping for predicted episodes (event-based i5 replacement;
  NOT the refuted duration filter).
- i19 (audit route 7 / source-free DA + S3.3 in-house FHMM-EM): PROMOTED to
  next (EXP-15, run 14 log): repair the blind dw/mw posteriors - decode-side
  fixes are exhausted (run 14: aggregate-constraining dw's blind posterior
  gave 0/209 aligned episodes). Self-training on PRE-SPLIT target aggregate
  only: decode house_1 pre-split mains with the i15 joint MAP, keep
  high-confidence joint states as pseudo-labels (emission-margin filter),
  head-only low-LR fine-tune, re-derive gates/amps from calib, decode eval.
  Scales the "25 calib windows" bottleneck to ~1 year of unlabeled target
  data; pre-split only, so no eval leakage. Guardrails from the closed
  head-FT family: freeze the encoder, early-stop on calib loss, watch gate
  drift (v7/v8 lesson). Watch: pseudo-label bias on the blind heads
  (fridge inverted in-domain per audit).
- i20 (audit route 6 / T-SSL tweak): SSL domain-adaptive pretraining on
  house_1 PRE-split aggregate (masked-window reconstruction pretext),
  validate by linear probe, then fit heads on source labels. E3-scale
  cost - schedule only if cheaper mechanisms plateau.
- i21 (analog-problems S2.6 BLS): periodicity scan for cycling loads
  (fridge period/duty prior). GT fridge is 83% <=36s fragments, so only
  useful via the decoder's transition priors, not long box episodes.
- i22 (analog-problems S2.7 + audit T-ACCT/UNILM knapsack): template
  match-and-subtract with residual-as-UNKNOWN, and energy accounting that
  scales attributed watts toward the aggregate - product-facing, but the
  accounting form targets coverage_pred/mean_nmae secondaries.
- i23 (audit S3.2 T-NORM): per-home z-normalization + learned de-
  normalization on the aggregate (TokenStats pattern) - label-free cross-
  house amplitude mitigation; relevant to the dishwasher amplitude clash
  (house_2 1984 W vs house_5 97 W signatures).
- i24 (run-9 evidence, fit-saturation management): SWA/weight averaging of
  the last-N epoch checkpoints or per-head capacity control - captures
  kettle's genuine +50% F1 from longer fit (0.214 -> 0.320) without the
  pos_weight-driven saturation of rare heads (wm sigOFF p50 0.98).

Protocol v2 backlog (2026-09-30, owner-approved external review; v1
episode metric retired - see H15_benchmark_validity + log run 28; family
cap ~3 runs per idea; ceiling check before declaring a device stuck;
primary mean_device_f1 with min_device_f1 guardrail):
- i25 (review 1, DONE - run 28, the v2 reference): rules v0 step-pair
  detector, profiles from aggregate-only calibration marks. mean 0.184,
  min 0.047. Known limits = the next ideas' targets.
- i26 (review 2): mine a year of unlabeled PRE-split events (~1 M
  samples), cluster switch-on signatures, name clusters from the 5 calib
  sessions -> unsupervised device dictionary; attacks kettle recall
  (P 0.952 / R 0.219: extraction misses most boils) and the fridge
  ~50 W impostor.
- i27 (review 3): train on target by pasting calib signatures into mined
  aggregate backgrounds - labeled-ish target data without eval contact.
- i28 (review 4): phase-sequence/HSMM for wm/dw - profiles 2240 vs
  2164 W are amplitude-identical; only phase structure (dw heater blocks
  + ~120 W pump; wm wash pulses) separates them.
- i29 (review 5, supersedes i21's v1 framing): fridge periodicity scan
  (BLS/autocorr on the step signal, not the raw aggregate - the raw-signal
  fold over-corrected to 1673 W in run-28 preflight).
- i30 (review 6): REFIT 20-house contrastive event encoder
  (data/gold/refit staged) - cross-dataset event representation.
- i31 (review 7, optional): 1 Hz track at native client cadence.
